01 straightpull 
	four times pulling it out straight 

02_angledpull - BAD
	A bunch (I lost count) of pulloffs using a force at the center pin of the cylindrical object 
	I used a fish scale to pull on the pin so there should be no moments applied about that point
	I don't think this data is very useful, I need to repeat with fewer trials and keep count

03_sidepull
	Three pulls in the -y direction
	Applied the force without a moment on the object's center pin 
	Looks like data was segmented well 

04_angledpull
	Three pulls in the -y +z direction
	Pulled at approximately 45 degree angle from the gripper
	Applied the force without a moment on the object's center pin 
	Looks like data was segmented well 

05_sidepull
	Four pulls in the +y direction
	Third one felt weak 
	Otherwise same as 03
	Seemed like going slower was more reliable 


06_angledpull
	Three pulls in the +y +z direction
	Pulled at approximately 45 degree angle from the gripper
	Otherwise same as 04

07_twistup
	TWO twists in the +x direction (trying to move in that direction) without displacing the object
	This felt really hard, wasn't a great feeling for the gripper, that's why I stopped at 2
