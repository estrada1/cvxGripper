	All these were tests to test what the force profiles looked like 

01_lever
	Pressing on the "pivot joint" of the rigid gripper to make sure I have the correct moment arm
	This should just be a horizontal force applied 75 mm out from the ATI surface, 
	So when transformed out to that location it should not have a moment 

02_straight
	Three tugs
	This one is hard since it slips and catches often 
	29.741
	47.066
	67.159

03_angle
	Pulling in the +z -y direction at ~45 deg but not precisely 
	23.495
	42.736
	58.600

04_twist
	22.555
	39.678
	60.342

05_twist
	30.633 
	43.715 
	51.394

08_side
	Trying to hit -19N in -y direction, seemed to have gotten it
	Had to look closely at the angle of the adhesive 

09_side
	Trying to hit 19N in +y direction 
	Seemed like a lot of sliding

10_side
	Repreating 09
