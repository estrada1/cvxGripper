01 straightpull 
	four times pulling it out straight 

02_angledpull - BAD
	A bunch (I lost count) of pulloffs using a force at the center pin of the cylindrical object 
	I used a fish scale to pull on the pin so there should be no moments applied about that point
	I don't think this data is very useful, I need to repeat with fewer trials and keep count

03_sidepull
	Three pulls in the -y direction
	Applied the force without a moment on the object's center pin 
	Looks like data was segmented well 

04_angledpull
	Three pulls in the -y +z direction
	Pulled at approximately 45 degree angle from the gripper
	Applied the force without a moment on the object's center pin 
	Looks like data was segmented well 

05_sidepull
	Four pulls in the +y direction
	Third one felt weak 
	Otherwise same as 03
	Seemed like going slower was more reliable 


06_angledpull
	Three pulls in the +y +z direction
	Pulled at approximately 45 degree angle from the gripper
	Otherwise same as 04

07_twistup
	TWO twists in the +x direction (trying to move in that direction) without displacing the object
	This felt really hard, wasn't a great feeling for the gripper, that's why I stopped at 2 
	
08_twistuppull
	Twisting like in 07 but pulling away too

09_twistdown
	Three trials Twisting in opposite way of 08

10_sidepull 
	Looks like side pull had compressive force to it last time 
	Repeating, pulling in -y direction but trying not to add compressive force 

11_sidepull4
	Three trials trying to pull with full tangential force
	Ended up having to pull out in normal direction to get adhesive to fail
	Side of the object starts to deform once I start tugging hard enough
	ATI does in fact have enough range, we are on the 130-10 setting

12_sidepull5
	Same as 11 but turning the poo
