Yesterday I realized I didn't have the sensor plugged in during any of the trials I did... 

LeftRight was measuring tangential direction
Moments was just twisting the hinge joint, trying not to impart forces
Pulling was pulling the gripper in the normal direction three times, then compressing once

Trial1 was trying to fill out the range of forces in the compliance and range of motion 

pin joint is mounted 165mm out from ATI surface in current compliance/configuration
