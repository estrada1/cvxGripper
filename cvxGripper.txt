Description: Keeping track of the files used to generate figures for Estrada ICRA 2017

Most of these figures are located in the folder, and three very useful subfolders: 
	cvxGripper
		functionsCvx
		functionsHelper
		dataGenerated - .mat files generated from code
		data - actual data gathered 

This code uses Boyd's Matlab toolbox, cvx
		http://cvxr.com/cvx/

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Figure Generation Scripts
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Varying Alpha 
	varyingAlpha.m 

Limit surface fig
	manualIsolines.m
		plotManualIsolines.m 	for actual plotting 
		limitSurfaceMz3D.m 		for generating data 

Pull-off tests figure
	DataCompare.m
	
	

Free Flyer Limits
	freeFlyerLimit.m

Articulated Jacobian Arm 
	jacobianMapping.m 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Helper Functions 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

defineParameters.m 
	Defines geometry and adhesion variables

defineGeometry.m
	Produces Acm matrix for a given geometry and object radius
	Acm means that it is forces/moments able to be exerted at COM


limitSurfaceMz3D.m 
	Generates limit surface over fx, fy, mz 

	limitSurfaceMz2D.m
		Sweep limit surface over fx / mz, for a given value of fy

LimitSurfaceMesh.m
	Sweep limit surface, calculating max fy for a given fx / mz
	This was more conducive to plotting using surf.m or mesh.m functions 




pulloffParse
	Meant for pull-off experiment
	Take a data filename in, spits out Fx, Fy, Mz failure point

pulloffData
	High level script for generating and plotting pulloff data from datafiles
	Defines where all the files are then calls pulloffParse on each file

powerActiveControl
	Optimizing for instantaneous power loss for kinetic energy 
	Given a velocity, what is the power transfer when you tug in a givendirection? 
	Early iterations on a plot to display this
